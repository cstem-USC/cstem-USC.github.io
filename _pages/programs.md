<b> What I talk about when I talk about (WITAWITA).</b> Have you ever wondered what "cryo EM" or "machine learning" really means? In STEM research, most of us are focused on a niche subject that we know a lot about. However, learning about different techniques, algorithms, and types of research is a great way to grow scientific curiousity and insight. These seminars are hosted in person in MCB 102 on campus (and also broadcasted on zoom) 1-2 times a month. Check our calendar below to make sure you attend our next WITAWITA seminar!
