	cSTEM takes pride in hosting many events and seminars in the Michelson Hall building for our students. We believe that these interactions and opportunities to meet fellow colleagus and faculty are crucial in converging research and collaborations from different fields.

<font color="firebrick"><b> What I talk about when I talk about (WITAWITA).</b></font> Have you ever wondered what "cryo EM" or "machine learning" really means? In STEM research, most of us are focused on a niche subject that we know a lot about. However, learning about different techniques, algorithms, and types of research is a great way to grow scientific curiousity and insight. These seminars are hosted in person in MCB 102 on campus (and also broadcasted on zoom) 1-2 times a month. Check our calendar below to make sure you attend our next WITAWITA seminar!
