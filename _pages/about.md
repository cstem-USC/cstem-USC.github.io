<center>Over the past century, science, technology engineering and mathematics have become progressively more specialized, each diverging into an array of complex sub-disciplines. While this divergence has led to significant advances in each area, it has also resulted in silos of expertise that run deep and often remain isolated. This hindered the further development of complex sciences and technologies such as modern medicine and biosciences. To facilitate the communication and collaboration of expertise from various disciplines to advance future STEM research, <font color="firebrick"><b>cSTEM</b></font> focuses on training current young researchers and trainees with techniques, knowledge, and most importantly, the language of a variety of research areas for advancing convergent research.</center>

<center><font color="firebrick"><b>The Michelson Center for Convergent Biosciences</b></font> was completed in 2017 and houses scientists and engineers from the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, USC Viterbi School of Engineering and Keck School of Medicine. A versatile set of research topics are worked on in the labs in this building. Our goal is to make use of the unique diversity of the center and provide a training and resource platform for researchers to gain knowledge and skills for interdisciplinary research, and provide a interface to connect interdisciplinary researchers and industry that requires specific hybrid needs.</center>
